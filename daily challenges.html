<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">SUBWAY SURFERS </h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px;">Subway Surfers (Danish: Undergrunds surfere) is an endless runner mobile game which is co-developed by Kiloo and SYBO Games, private companies based in Denmark. It is available on Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, Amazon Fire Tablet, and Windows Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.[2] In the game, players take the role of young graffiti artists who, upon being caught in the act of "tagging" a metro railway site, run through the railroad tracks to escape from the inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins, power-ups, and many other items along the way while simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects. They can also jump on top of the trains and surf with hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle, gets caught by the inspector, or gets hit by a train, at which point the game ends. Special events, such as the Season Hunt and other, can result in in-game rewards and characters.</p>
